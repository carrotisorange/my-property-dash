           <h3>What is My Property Dash?</h3>
           <p>
               My Property Dash is a property management system that lets landlords manage their property anytime and anywhere with minimal effort. Unlike OTA (Trivago, Agoda, etc.) that allows
               landlors to advertise their property online as a transient, My Property Dash offers longterm stay for tenants.

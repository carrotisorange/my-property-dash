              <li>Differentiation. How we differentiate ourselves in a sea of sameness will make us stand out in the market. 
              Our products or services may be the same as our competitors but the customer experience is different each time. 
              Today's economy and market in a pandemic may not be something that we can control but the experience we give to 
              our customers is directly impacted by us. The ability to capture that customer is in how we provide that experience 
              for our customer that differentiates us from others. 
              </li>
              <li>
              Add Value. Doing a little bit extra for the customer will be the decisive factor in the perspective of the
               customer that we serve.
               It does not have to take too much or cost too much. It could be a warm greeting and a small gift. 
               Research shows that a warm greeting and a small gift has a 46% increase in the revenue the customer brings. 
              </li>
              <li>
              Reduce maintenance. Immediate improvement of the experience we provide the customer can be immediately achieved by 
              reducing waiting time, being responsive, and being accessible. It is not a one time experience but must be consistent. 
              It has to be a part of our DNA, our purpose, to make it easier for our customers
              </li>
          </ol> 

          <p>
          Technology can help us be customer-centric by automating processes, we reduce waiting and be more responsive to our customers needs. Data gives us the information that we need to cater to the special needs of our customers and provides valuable insights that can help us differentiate ourselves, to add value to our services,  and reduce maintenance.

      <h4>Guidelines on Concessions on Residential and Commercial Rents During Covid 19 in the Philippines.</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="card-body">
      
      <p id="guidelines-during-covid-19">
      Republic Act 11469 known as the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act declared as a policy during the Covid 19 pandemic to provide for
       a minimum thirty (30) day grace period on residential and commercial rents for MSMEs falling due within the period 
       of the Enhance Community Quarantine (ECQ), Modified Enhanced Community Quarantine (MECQ), General Community Quarantine 
       (GCQ) or until such a time that the community quarantine is lifted, without incurring interests, penalties, fees, and 
       other charges. 
      </p>
       
      <p>
      The grant for a minimum 30 day grace period shall commence from the lifting of the covered community quarantine or from the 
      date that the tenant is allowed to resume employment or business operation, whichever comes first, without incurring interests, 
      penalties, fees, and other charges.
      </p>

      <p>
      The grace period may be availed of the residential or commercial lessees who have lost their income during any 
      of the community quarantines, or whose employer or businesses where not allowed to operate by law/regulations/ordinances 
      relevant to any covered community quarantine. The commencement of the grace period shall be from the date that the employer 
      or business was allowed to resume operations regardless of whether or not the lessee opts to go back to work or resume business 
      operations. 
      </p>

      <p>
      Cumulative amounts of rents falling due within any of the covered community quarantine, shall be equally amortized in six (6) 
      months following the end of the 30 day minimum grace period, without interests, penalties, fees and other charges, which amount 
      shall be added to the monthly rent due. To avail of the 6-month concession, the lessee shall provide the lessor a signed 
      Promissory Note of letter, undertaking to pay the deferred rent/s in accordance herewith, and failure thereof shall make 
      such deferred rents due and demandable immediately following the end of the minimum 30 days grace period. 
      </p>

      <p>
      Lessors are not obliged to refund residential and commercial rents paid by the lessees before or during the period of
       ECQ or any version thereof. 
      </p>

      <p>
      Lessors of commercial rent for MSMEs who wish to extend greater generosity may totally or partially waive the 
      commercial rents that are falling due during the covered community quarantine; grant reprieve or discounted 
      amount of commercial rents due after the covered community quarantine; open for renegotiation the Lease Term 
      Agreements with the lessees; or use other recourse to mitigate the
       impact of a covered community quarantine to the MSMEs. 
      </p>

      <p>
      No eviction for failure to pay the residential or commercial rent due may be enforced from May 17, 2020 when ECQ took 
      effect until the end of the grace period granted by the lessor to a lessee. 
      </p>

      <p>
      Lessors may be held criminally, civilly, or administratively liable for failure to abide by relevant laws, regulations and/ 
      or ordinances. The same applies to lessees who fail to pay their obligations and abide by the terms of their promissory note.

        Never let a crisis go to waste. In a pandemic, there are opportunities. We need to take advantage of this pandemic to become innovative, to experiment, 
        and to optimize. This health crisis allows us the time in the property management industry to digitally transform our businesses and to use technology as
         a strategy to expand our business and increase the number of properties managed even during any crisis. A Property Management System is essential 
         especially during a crisis, when we have to manage our properties remotely. Our customers may be the same but their behaviors and their needs have changed.
          We need to adapt and continue to remain relevant in this new normal. Let us reinvent our business models to become digitally savvy property managers to answer 
          the changing needs of our tenants and property owners. This crisis has pushed us to face our broken systems. We realize that these problems are existing even 
          before the pandemic. Let us use tech tools available that will help us fix these problems. There are solutions out there and they require ingenuity, quality, 
          technology, agility, and leadership. Furthermore, using technology encourages us to reskill our workforces. Our biggest asset goes home with a new thing they learned.
           A property management system is teaching our workforce new skills and once they appreciate how a system makes their work easier, they have more time to learn other skillsets. 
           We need to evolve and update our mindsets, our knowledge, our skills, and our systems to navigate this new normal.

      <p id="why-did-your-start-property-manager-online">
        We are property managers with about a thousand listings, we were using traditional marketing and many steps of leasing procedures, 
        paper and pen to sign up tenant info sheets, contracts, billing statements and receipts. We monitor transactions through spreadsheets 
        and it takes a day to process a report. At one point, our operations are so wrapped up into administrative work that we are spending less 
        time strengthening our customer relations. We spend so much time looking for documents and less time on satisfying customer requests. 
        We realize that if we want to stay in this business and grow, we need to automate our processes so we can focus on the more important 
        aspects of the business like providing good customer service experience while maintaining efficient operations and that’s how thepropertymanager.online was born. - The Founders.

          Renting out a room or a few number of rooms to tenants is a good source of passive income if you are not doing the property management work. 
          But if you factor in the work of looking for tenants, interviewing tenants, explaining house rules, closing contracts, then managing tenants,
           billing and collecting rent, and every work in between, the number of hours spent is actual working hours spent to manage and operate a rental property. 
           Growing and expanding your business is possible with a property management system that stores all your business’ historical data and tenant information in one place. 
           Even if you are not yet looking to expand your business, a property management system is still a good investment as it saves you hours of work that can be done in minutes. 
           Work that is a function of 3 persons can be done by 1 person with a good property management system. This savings in time and people is good for the bottom line.
